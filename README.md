The NEURON model reproduces Fig. 6d of the manuscript "Layer 5 myelination gates corticothalamic coincidence detection" by Jamann et al.

Install the latest version of NEURON from https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/

When the folder is compiled, using the mknrndll script, the simulation
can be started with the hoc files "Fig. 6d_Suppl_Fig. 8e" or "_Fig. 6e"

In the RunControl window hit "init & run". 

_Fig. 6d_Suppl_Fig. 8e runs the deterministic model evoking 4 action potentials. 

 Using the "Myelin properties" window cortical, white matter or POm demyelination can be selected, and myelin can be reinstalled via the "remyelination" button. This replicates data shown in Supplementary Figure 8e

_Fig. 6e runs the stochastic model with fluctuating voltages mimicking synaptic inputs.
